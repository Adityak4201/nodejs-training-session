## JavaScript Operators

JavaScript provides a wide range of operators for performing various operations. Here are some commonly used operators:

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical calculations.

- Addition: `+`
- Subtraction: `-`
- Multiplication: `*`
- Division: `/`
- Modulus: `%`
- Increment: `++`
- Decrement: `--`

### Assignment Operators

Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables.

- Assignment: `=`
- Addition assignment: `+=`
- Subtraction assignment: `-=`
- Multiplication assignment: `*=`
- Division assignment: `/=`
- Modulus assignment: `%=`

### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values.

- Equal to: `==`
- Not equal to: `!=`
- Strict equal to: `===`
- Strict not equal to: `!==`
- Greater than: `>`
- Less than: `<`
- Greater than or equal to: `>=`
- Less than or equal to: `<=`

### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or negate conditions.

- Logical AND: `&&`
- Logical OR: `||`
- Logical NOT: `!`

### Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.

- Syntax: `condition ? expression1 : expression2`

### Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform bitwise operations on binary numbers.

- Bitwise AND: `&`
- Bitwise OR: `|`
- Bitwise XOR: `^`
- Bitwise NOT: `~`
- Left shift: `<<`
- Right shift: `>>`
- Zero-fill right shift: `>>>`

### Other Operators

- typeof: Returns the type of a variable.
- instanceof: Checks if an object is an instance of a specific class.

These are some of the operators available in JavaScript.
