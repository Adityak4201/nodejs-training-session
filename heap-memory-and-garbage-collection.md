## Heap Memory in JavaScript

Heap memory in JavaScript is a large region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation. It's where objects, strings, and closures are stored. When you create an object in JavaScript, what you're really doing is allocating memory on the heap.

The memory life cycle in JavaScript is pretty straightforward:

1. Allocate the memory you need.
2. Use the allocated memory (read, write).
3. Release the allocated memory when it is not needed anymore.

The first and third parts are explicit in all languages. However, in JavaScript, most of the time, the memory is allocated when you, for instance, define new variables and create objects, and deallocation is performed automatically by the garbage collector.

The garbage collector's job is to track memory allocation and use in order to find when a piece of allocated memory is not needed any longer in which case, it will automatically free it. This process is an integral part of JavaScript performance optimization.

However, the garbage collector is not perfect. It can't perfectly determine whether memory is still needed or not, which can lead to memory leaks. This is why understanding how memory works in JavaScript can be important for writing efficient code.

## Garbage Collection in JavaScript

Garbage collection is a form of automatic memory management that is used by many modern programming languages, including JavaScript. The purpose of garbage collection is to identify and discard objects that are no longer needed by a program, allowing their resources to be reclaimed and used for other purposes.

In JavaScript, memory is allocated when new variables are created and is "automatically" freed when the variables are no longer used. This process of freeing up memory is done by the garbage collector. The garbage collector operates primarily via a form of reference counting.

If the reference to a memory location is lost, the garbage collector will reclaim that memory location. However, it's not always this simple because JavaScript can have circular references where two or more objects reference each other, causing them to be unreachable from the root but still referenced. To solve this, modern browsers use an algorithm called mark-and-sweep.

In the mark-and-sweep algorithm, the garbage collector starts from the root objects and marks them as reachable. Then it visits all other objects recursively and marks them as well. All unvisited objects are then removed.
