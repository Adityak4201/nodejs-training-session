# Assignment

1. Create two APIs in NodeJS:
   - Develop an API that retrieves information from the public API https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts and then stores this data in a file on the server.
   - Create a separate API that accepts an id parameter, searches for the corresponding data in the locally saved file on the server. If the data is not found in the file, the API further queries the original API. If the data is located, it is appended to the file, and the information is returned.
